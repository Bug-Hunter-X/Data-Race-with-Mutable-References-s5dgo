This repository demonstrates a subtle data race that can occur in Rust when manipulating mutable references. The core issue involves creating multiple mutable references to the same variable. This typically results in a compiler error; however, if managed carefully, this can lead to unpredictable and hard-to-debug behavior, especially in multi-threaded scenarios. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this type of error.
